📊 Amazon Sales Performance Dashboard (Power BI)

This project presents an interactive Amazon Sales Dashboard built using Microsoft Power BI to analyze sales, profit, returns, customers, and product performance across multiple years.

The dashboard uses Amazon sales data and transforms raw data into meaningful business insights through Power Query for data cleaning and transformation, and DAX for creating dynamic measures and calculations. It enables users to track KPIs, identify top-performing cities, products, and customers, and understand sales trends by category and segment.
